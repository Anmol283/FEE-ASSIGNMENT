            <p>By 2100, India's Population To Decline, But Still Be 2.5 Times That Of China
            India's population is projected to peak in the early 2060s at about 1.7 billion and then decline by 12%
            
            United Nations: India's population is projected to peak in the early 2060s at about 1.7 billion and then decline by 12 per cent, but the country will remain the world's most populous throughout the century, the United Nations has said.
            The World Population Prospects 2024 report, released here on Thursday, said that the world's population is expected to continue growing over the coming 50-60 years, reaching a peak of around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, the global population is projected to start declining gradually, falling to 10.2 billion people by the end of the century.</p>

            <p>New Delhi: Adani Ports Managing Director Karan Adani today hailed Kerala's Vizhinjam Port welcoming first mothership calling it a "glorious achievement in Indian maritime history":
            "San Fernando – now berthed at our harbour is a symbol of a new, glorious achievement in Indian maritime history. It is a messenger that will tell the world that India's first transshipment terminal and the largest deepwater port has begun commercial operations."
            
            "No other port in India – including our own highly advanced Mundra Port – has these technologies. What we have already installed here is South Asia's most advanced container handling technology. And once we complete the automation and the Vessel Traffic Management System, Vizhinjam will be in a class of its own as one of the most technologically sophisticated transshipment ports in the world," he added.</p>
